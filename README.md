<p> A queue is a simple data structure that allows elements to be inserted from one end, called the rear, and deleted from the other end, called the front.</p>
<h2> Remember:</h2>
<p>1). Rear is also called Tail </p>
<p>2). Front is also called head </p>


<p> This behavior, where the element which was added first is deleted first is called <b> FIFO </p> (First in First Out)
