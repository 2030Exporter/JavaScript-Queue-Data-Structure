<p> A <b> queue </b> is a simple data structure that allows elements to be inserted from one end, called the rear, and deleted from the other end, called the front.</p>
<h2> Remember:</h2>
<p>1). Rear is also called Tail </p>
<p>2). Front is also called head </p>


<p> This behavior, where the element which was added first is deleted first is called <b> FIFO  (First in First Out)</b></p>

<h2> The image below shows a simple real world example, People (Human Being)  on a queue,  let say customers in a bank queue the customer who entered first will be served  first </p>
